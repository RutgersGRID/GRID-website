# Writing Accessible and Effective Alt-Text for Images

In this short guide, we'll describe the benefits of alt-text for image descriptions, how to write effective alt-text.

## Benefits of Alt-Text

Alt-text (alternative text) is essential for making digital content accessible to everyone, including people who use screen readers or have images turned off. Well-written alt-text:

- Provides equal access to information for users with visual impairments.
- Ensures compliance with accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG, ADA).
- Enhances user experience for all.

## Guidelines for Effective Alt-Text

### Write Clear, Purposeful Descriptions

- **Be concise:** Use only as many words as are needed to convey the essential information.
- **Avoid redundancies:** Don’t repeat information already present in surrounding text or captions.
- **Context matters:** Describe what’s important about the image in its context, not every visual detail.
- **Match audience language/understanding:** Use terminology appropriate for your readers. Avoid jargon unless relevant for the course content.

## Avoid Common Alt-Text Mistakes

- **Avoid generic descriptions:** Don’t use “image of,” “photo of,” or “graphic” unless necessary.
- **Don’t over-describe details:** Focus on what’s relevant to the context.
- **Don’t ignore context:** Tailor the description to the image’s purpose in the content.

## Handle Different Image Types Appropriately

Different types of images convey different types of information, and writing effective image descriptions can take a bit of extra care.

- **Decorative:** Mark images that do not add informational value as decorative. This means using `alt=""` for images in HTML.
- **Informational:** Describe the content and purpose (e.g., “Bar chart showing sales growth from 2020 to 2024”).
- **Functional:** Describe the function, not the appearance (e.g., “Search button”).
- **Images with text:** Include the text in the alt attribute if it’s not elsewhere.
- **Complex:** Summarize the main point and provide a longer description in the main text if needed (e.g., for infographics).

### Create Detailed Descriptions for Complex Content

Some complex images may require additional work to describe accurately and effectively. Here are some guidelines for more complex images.

- **Data visualizations:** Summarize the key message, trends, or data points.
- **Maps:** Describe the area shown and any important features or markers.
- **Screenshots:** Explain what is visible and its relevance.
- **Unique images (equations, sequences, etc):** Provide a textual equivalent or explanation.

Reminder: If an image is not offering any additional context or content, mark the image as decorative.

## Examples

### Example 1 - a painting

The Ally Course Accessibility Report tool in Canvas uses the following example.

<img src="compliant_alt_text_media\960px-Van_Gogh_-_Feld_mit_Mohnblumen.jpeg" alt-text="" />

(This version of the painting is in the public domain and was pulled from [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=9522155) after being reproduced from an artbook.)  

In the example, Van Gogh's painting, Feld mit Mohnblumen (Field of Poppies), is shown.

Ally suggests that for an art class, the alt tag might be "A painting by Van Gogh in Post-Impressionism using dramatic brush strokes. It shows a field with poppies in the foreground, trees on the background, and dark skies.

However, for a history class, the alt tag might be "A field covered with poppies. Poppies have become a symbol of remembrance for World War I."

Depending on your subject or audience, you may have a different description for this image used in your class.

- Entry Level Art History - "Post-impressionist landscape with red poppy field, tree line, and swirling blue sky.
- Higher Level Art History - "Expressive landscape with red poppy field, tree line, and dynamic post-impressionist sky, evoking late 19th-century modernism."

### Example 2 - a complex image

<img src="compliant_alt_text_media\paper_open_feeder_guard_xp320_420.jpg" alt-text="" />

This image was taken from a guide on how to load paper into a printer. The text next to the image said only "Flip the feeder guard forward." If that were also used as the alt-text, a screen reader would repeat that phrase, possibly confusing your audience.

If you wanted to provide instructions on how to do this for someone who was visually impaired, the best practice would be to describe how it can be done. This would be too much information for an alt-tag, so you'd likely put the full text into the body of the instructions and mark the imnage as decorative. If it is also part of a series of instructions, you may also wish to add something to help the audience understand what step their on in the sequence, even if the image itself didn't use numbers.

> Step 2. You will need to flip the feeder guard forward. You will find the feeder guard located at the back of the top of the printer. Lift up on the back end and then rotate it forward so it is resting on top of the printer cover.

If the steps are more complicated, you may wish to break them down even further, into a bulleted or numbered list of steps.

### Example 3 - A chart with data

The following is a chart taken from a [2025 State of Consumer AI article by Menlo Ventures](https://menlovc.com/perspective/2025-the-state-of-consumer-ai/), which surveyed 5000 US adults.

<img src="compliant_alt_text_media\ai_assistant_usage.png" alt-text="" />

This example of a chart shows a breakdown of which AI tools users are using, shown from most used to least used, with a catch-all category for the less used options.

For complex charts, you need to make sure you are detailing the parts of the chart that are important for your subject. Again, your subject and audience should help inform what you what to detail.

Any useful description of this chart will likely be too long for alt-text, and should be moved to the main body of the text.

In this case, you may wish to provide additional context.

> In a survey of more than 5000 US adults, General AI Assistant Usage was as follows:
Percentages represent usage rates:
OpenAI – 28%
Google Gemini – 23%
Meta – 18%
Amazon Alexa - 18%
Apple Siri - 16%
Other (including Claude, DeepSeek, Grok, Microsoft Copilot, and Perplexity) – 33%

## Using Generative AI to Write Effective Image Descriptions

Generative AI can be used to do some of this work, though you will need to be careful in how you prompt the AI. For more details, review our [Writing WCAG Compliant Alt-Text with Generative AI Guidelines](resources\1.2__Writing_Compliant_Alt_Text_with_GenAI\1.2__Writing_Compliant_Alt_Text_with_GenAI.md).

??? - since this is now more generically about alt-text, should this meeting tool go to the IDs instead of the EMTechers?
