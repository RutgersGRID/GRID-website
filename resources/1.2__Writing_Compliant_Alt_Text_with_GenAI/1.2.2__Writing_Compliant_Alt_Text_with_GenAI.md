# Writing WCAG Compliant Alt-Text with Generative AI

This guideline expands on the information provided in the [Writing Accessible and Effective Alt-Text for Images Guideline](resources\1.2__Writing_Compliant_Alt_Text_with_GenAI\1.2__Writing_WCAG_Compliant_Alt_Text.md). Please review that document to learn more about the benfits and guidelines for effective alt-text.

In this short guide, we'll offer some guidelines on how to use generative AI to create write effective alt-text and image descriptions.

## Using Generative AI to Create Clear, Purposeful Descriptions

As discussed in the [Writing Accessible and Effective Alt-Text for Images Guideline](resources\1.2__Writing_Compliant_Alt_Text_with_GenAI\1.2__Writing_WCAG_Compliant_Alt_Text.md), the context of your course is often required to get effective descriptions for images.

### 1. Provide Context and Specificity in Your Prompts

- **Include course or subject context:** Specify what the image is used for so the AI can provide contextual descriptions.
- **Specify image type:** Indicate if it’s a chart, photo, diagram, etc.
- **Define audience:** Note if the description is for beginners, experts, or a general audience.

### 2. Use Effective Prompts – Example Templates

- **Basic images:** “Describe this image for a biology 101 student.”
- **Complex images:** “Summarize the key trends in this line graph for a business report.”
- **Functional images:** “Describe the purpose of this button in a web interface.”

### 3. Review and Refine as Needed

- **AI can get things wrong:**
  - Always check the generated alt-text for accuracy and clarity.
  - Look for redundancies or unnecessary details.
  - Ensure the description matches the image’s context and purpose.

### 4. Watch Out for AI Weaknesses and Limitations

- **Cultural context:** AI may miss cultural references or nuances.
- **Technical content:** AI might omit or misinterpret technical details—review carefully for accuracy.
- **Hallucinations:** AI sometimes make things up. This is referred to as "hallucinations" by generative AI companies. It is usually caused by extrneous additional information. If you ask for descriptions of many images in the same chat with a generative AI tool, it can sometimes become overwhelmed with data and mix the contents.

## Examples

This section uses the same examples as our effective alt-text guidelines, but has additional information for when you use a generative AI to create image descriptions for you.

### Example 1 - a painting

The Ally Course Accessibility Report tool in Canvas uses the following example.

<img src="compliant_alt_text_media\960px-Van_Gogh_-_Feld_mit_Mohnblumen.jpeg" alt-text="" />

(This version of the painting is in the public domain and was pulled from [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=9522155) after being reproduced from an artbook.)  

In the example, Van Gogh's painting, Feld mit Mohnblumen (Field of Poppies), is shown.

Ally suggests that for an art class, the alt tag might be "A painting by Van Gogh in Post-Impressionism using dramatic brush strokes. It shows a field with poppies in the foreground, trees on the background, and dark skies.

However, for a history class, the alt tag might be "A field covered with poppies. Poppies have become a symbol of remembrance for World War I."

#### Getting help from an AI

When asking a generative AI to create the description for this painting, you should make sure your prompt gives the AI the context it needs to create an effective description that also delivers on the meaning of the image in your course.

Someone's created the [Image Description Specialist](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-OeMRwWONc-image-description-specialist), a custom GPT in ChatGPT based on WCAG guidelines. We can try using this tool to get a descritopn for the Van Gogh image.

When this image was shared with the GPT with no additional instructions, it responded with:
> Colorful field of red poppies under a swirling blue sky with tall trees lining the horizon.

When instructed that the image was being used in a history course, it responded with:
> Post-impressionist painting of a poppy field with swirling sky, representing early modern European art.

When instructed that the image was for a WWI history course, the result was pretty close to the suggestion from ALLY:
> Expressionist-style painting of a red poppy field under a turbulent sky, symbolizing WWI remembrance.

When instructed that the image was for a entry level art history course, it offered:
> Post-impressionist landscape with red poppy field, tree line, and swirling blue sky.

And for a doctorate level art history course, it offered:
> Expressive landscape with red poppy field, tree line, and dynamic post-impressionist sky, evoking late 19th-century modernism.

Each of generative ai responses also had a long description, which could have been placed into the main body along side the image. If you chose to use the long description in this way, you would want to make the image decorative (`alt=""`).

### Example 2 - a complex image

<img src="compliant_alt_text_media\paper_open_feeder_guard_xp320_420.jpg" alt-text="" />

This image was taken from a guide on how to load paper into a printer. The text next to the image said only "Flip the feeder guard forward." If that were also used as the alt-text, a screen reader would just repeat that phrase twice.

When this image was shared with the ["Image Description Specialist GPT"](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-OeMRwWONc-image-description-specialist), it offered:

> Hand lifting the document cover of a flatbed printer from the corner.

The longer description was more useful, but still didn't treat the image as instructional:

> This instructional image shows a flatbed printer with a close-up inset highlighting how to lift the document cover. The inset focuses on the top-left corner of the cover, showing a hand gripping and rotating the cover upward. The highlighted portion of the cover is shaded blue to indicate the area to lift.

When asked to try again and to give an instructional description for someone who was visually impaired, it changed the long description to a much more useful bulleted set of steps, but the instructions were incorrect after quite a few tries.

Here's one example:

> 1. Locate the printer in front of you with the paper output tray facing toward you.
> 2. Place one hand on the front edge of the flat top panel.
> 3. With your fingers underneath the front lip, gently lift the panel upward.
> 4. Continue lifting until the top cover is fully raised, exposing the glass scanner bed beneath.

For an image this complex, the amount of prompting you may need to get a useful description may be more work than writing that description yourself.

### Example 3 - A chart with data

The following is a chart taken from a [2025 State of Consumer AI article by Menlo Ventures](https://menlovc.com/perspective/2025-the-state-of-consumer-ai/), which surveyed 5000 US adults.

<img src="compliant_alt_text_media\ai_assistant_usage.png" alt-text="" />

The chart shows a breakdown of which AI tools users are using, shown from most used to least used, with a catch-all category for the less used options.

When this image was shared with the ["Image Description Specialist GPT"](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-OeMRwWONc-image-description-specialist), it offered the following for the alt-text:

> Bar chart showing U.S. adult AI assistant usage: Other 33%, OpenAI 28%, Google 23%, Meta 18%, Amazon 18%, Apple 16%.

While that does a fairly good job of describing the content of the chart, if the specifics are importent to the context of the lesson or course, you may want to move more of the details to the main body of the text. For example, while the alt-text does correctly show that the "Other" category is 33%, it doesn't designate which AI are listed. 

The specialist GPT also offered the following long description:

> A horizontal bar chart titled "The AI Assistants Consumers Reach for First" with the subtitle "Total General AI Assistant Usage Among All U.S. Adults." Percentages represent usage rates:
OpenAI – 28% (logo shown)
Google Gemini – 23% (Gemini logo)
Meta – 18% (Meta AI logo)
Amazon Alexa – 18% (Alexa logo)
Apple Siri – 16% (Siri logo)
Other – 33% (includes Claude, DeepSeek, Grok, Microsoft Copilot, and Perplexity logos)

Not only does this longer description break down who was listed in the "Other" category, but it also did a better job of helping establish that OpenAI had the largest share, when compared to how the alt-text description listed "Other" first.

However, it also added text to inform the audience that it showed logos for each company, which is not important to the context of the chart.

For detailed charts with a lot of important data, it's likely going to be necessary to copy any important data into the main body of the document or a larger description of an image that isn't part of a document. When doing this, you should make the chart decorative (`alt=""`).

## Default Prompts for Different Image Types

If you don't want to use the specialist GPT shared above, here are some default prompts for different image types. Note that in almost all cases, providing a bit of additional context clues for the AI will result in better alt-text and descriptions.

### Basic Informational Images

```Text
"Create WCAG 2.2 compliant alt-text for this image. Keep it concise (under 125 characters) and focus on the essential information that supports the surrounding content."
```

### Educational Content Images

```Text
"Generate alt-text for this image used in a [subject] course for [level] students. Focus on educationally relevant details and use appropriate terminology for the audience."
```

### Data Visualizations

```Text
"Create alt-text for this chart/graph that summarizes the key data trend or main finding. Include the chart type and primary insight in under 125 characters."
```

### Functional Images (buttons, icons, controls)

```Text
"Describe the function or action of this UI element for screen reader users. Focus on what it does, not what it looks like."
```

### Complex Technical Images

```Text
"Generate both concise alt-text (under 125 characters) and a longer description for this technical diagram/screenshot used in [context]. The alt-text should summarize the main purpose."
```

### Historical/Cultural Images

```Text
"Create alt-text for this image used in a [subject] course. Consider the historical/cultural significance and context relevant to the lesson."
```

### Scientific Images

```Text
"Generate alt-text for this scientific image showing [process/concept]. Focus on the key scientific information visible and relevant to [subject] students."
```

### Step-by-Step Instructional Images

```Text
"Create alt-text for this instructional image. If the surrounding text already describes the action, focus on key visual details that aren't mentioned. If this is the primary instruction, describe the action clearly."
```

### Images with Text

```Text
"Transcribe any text visible in this image and include it in the alt-text. If there's also visual information important to understanding, include that as well."
```

### Decorative Images

```Text
"Determine if this image is decorative (adds no informational value) or informational. If decorative, respond with 'DECORATIVE - use empty alt attribute.' If informational, provide appropriate alt-text."
```

## Template for Context-Specific Prompts

Finally, here is a template for creating a context-specific prompt if none of the above examples work for you. 
To use this, you'll need to give the ai additional information:

- [image type]
- [course subject]
- [audience level]
- [topic / concept]
- [specific aspect relevant to your content]

```Text
"Create WCAG 2.2 compliant alt-text for this [image type] used in a [course subject] for [audience level]. 
The image supports content about [topic/concept]. Focus on [specific aspect relevant to your content]. Keep alt-text under 125 characters."
```

**Example using the template:**

```Text
"Create WCAG 2.2 compliant alt-text for this flowchart used in a project management course for graduate students. 
The image supports content about risk assessment processes. Focus on the decision points and flow direction. Keep alt-text under 125 characters."
```
