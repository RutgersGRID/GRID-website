    <p>Improving learning and education is a key factor for students success. That is why GRID works with faculty, staff, students and others within the Rutgers community to build innovative games, immersive designs and engaging experiences.</p>
    
    <p>These games can be integrated with Canvas, the university's main learning management system.</p>
    
    <h3>Gaming Analytics</h3>
    
    <p>If you are creating the game as part of a research project, or need data for other reasons, we can help collect that data. See our <a href="https://grid.rutgers.edu/services/gaming-analytics">Gaming Analytics page</a> for more information.</p>
    
    <p>Explore below some of our most recent Education Game Design projects.</p>
