    <p>GRID can help you design, develop, and deploy augmented, virtual, or extended technologies, assisting in building immersive applications, for desktop, mobile, or headsets.</p>
    
    <p>Whether you are looking for a game, interactive experiential lesson, or conference networking tool, GRID can help you create the ideal application for your needs.</p>
    
    <h3>Unsure what the difference is?</h3>
    
    <p><strong>Augmented Reality</strong> allows you to interact with real-world objects that can load digital objects for additional information, entertainment, or a bit of both.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Virtual Reality</strong> immerses you fully into a digital environment, allowing you to explore spaces you might not be able to reach or that have never existed in the real world.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Extended or Mixed Reality</strong> allows you to interact with digital objects in the physical world; displays overlayed on top of the real world, audio cues to let you know when to turn or when youâ€™ve reached your destination, or a virtual tour guide showing your around a real world space are all possible in Extended Reality.</p>
    
    <p>Explore below some of our most recent augmented and extended reality projects.</p>
