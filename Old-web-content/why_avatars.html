    <h1>Why Avatars?</h1>

    <p>There are many reasons avatars may be used.</p>

    <ul>
        <div>Some people like the <strong>anonymity</strong> they provide.</div>
        <div>Some see them as <strong>masks or costumes</strong> and change them quite frequently.</div>
        <div>Some use them as a <strong>show of support</strong> for a cause or a favorite media series.</div>
        <div>Some like them because they let you <strong>showcase yourself in new ways</strong>!</div>
        <div>Others like to <strong>explore different aspects of themselves</strong>, or experiment with ideas they're not ready to try in real life, such as exploring parts of their identity.</div>
        <div>Some companies have <strong>custom avatars created for their staff</strong>, either to create a shared sense of community or to allow their staff to show off their own personalities.</div>
    </ul>

    <p>And of course, some avatars are just for fun. There doesn't have to be a meaning behind it!</p>

    <h2>Here are a few of the avatars our assistant director, Maka Gradin has used over the last couple of decades.</h2>

    <div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; gap: 24px; margin-bottom: 30px;">
        <div class="avatar-section" style="border-bottom: none; padding-bottom: 0;">
            <img src="avatar-Maka-CodeCombat.png" alt="A realistic, but cartoony avatar of a man with light skin, brown hair, and a full brown beard. He is wearing black-framed glasses and a brown collared shirt. He has a neutral expression." style="height:300px; width:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;">
            At CodeCombat a photo of the employee and a description of what they wanted for an avatar was sent to a team of artists, who would often go through several iterations before landing on something the employee liked. They used avatars in the style of the art of their game, and this was created for Maka.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="avatar-section" style="border-bottom: none; padding-bottom: 0;">
            <img src="avatar-Maka-wielding-mask-selfie.jpg" alt="A person wearing a black welding helmet with the visor down. A green and yellow sticker is visible on the top of the helmet, and a hint of a blue hooded sweatshirt is seen below. The visor shows a purple-tinted reflection and the wearer's face is hidden behind it." style="height:300px; width:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;">
            This avatar is a simple selfie I took while wearing a welding mask. I used it on a Discord server for Repl when customers asked me to upload an avatar. They later had a great deal of fun editing it and changing what was seen in the glass area of the mask.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="avatar-section" style="border-bottom: none; padding-bottom: 0;">
            <img src="avatar-Maka-ReadyPlayer.me.png" alt="A 3D rendering of a man's head and shoulders. He has light brown skin, gray hair parted on the side, a gray beard, and a mustache. He is wearing black-framed glasses and a light blue collared shirt with two visible buttons. His eyes are brown and he has a neutral expression." style="height:300px; width:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;">
            This avatar was created using <a href="https://readyplayer.me/avatar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ReadyPlayer Me's</a> AI tools and based on a selfie. I created it to be used within <a href="https://docs.hubsfoundation.org/welcome.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hubs, a Virtual Worlds engine</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="avatar-section" style="border-bottom: none; padding-bottom: 0;">
            <img src="avatar-Maka_stardew_portrait.png" alt="A pixel art avatar of a man with light skin, gray hair that is short on the sides with a fade, and a gray beard and mustache. He is wearing round, green-rimmed glasses, a dark blue open cardigan over a gray shirt, and has a neutral expression." style="height:300px; width:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;">
            This avatar was created using the <a href="https://jazzybee.itch.io/sdvcharactercreator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stardew Valley Character Portrait maker</a>, inspired by the very popular <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stardew Valley</a> game and it creates avatars in the style of the game.

    <p>At CodeCombat, Maka, as art director, worked with employees on getting a custom avatar that matched the art style of the game. Some immediately had ideas and made very specific requests such as showing support for a sports team, or dressing themselves as a character in a favorite game. Others had never thought about an avatar, shrugged, and asked me to come up with ideas.</p>
    <p>The avatars had different meanings to each person and some became very attached to them. Maka came across an avatar he had created for a user at a cognitive science conference years after both had moved on to other work</p>
