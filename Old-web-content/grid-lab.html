        <p>We aim to bring students, faculty, and community members together to experience cutting-edge VR and AR technologies. With a focus on empathy and <a href="https://tlt.rutgers.edu/article/spatial-justice-introduction">spatial justice</a>, we strive to create immersive experiences that resonate with all users.</p>
        
        <p>Key offerings include multi-player VR experiences, virtual productions, augmented spaces, and simulations. These initiatives align with Rutgers University's DEIA+ mission, emphasizing our commitment to Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, Accessibility, and a sense of Belonging.</p>
        
        <p>We believe immersive technologies are a key component in this mission. By providing access to typically inaccessible technology, we open new avenues for creativity and learning.</p>
        
        <p>The center boasts a dedicated space of 900 square feet, designed to accommodate multiple VR headsets, motion capture equipment, and other advanced technology. This space is not just about technology; it’s also a comfortable and collaborative working environment. Researchers, students, and the community can come together to innovate, experiment, and share ideas in this state-of-the-art facility.</p>
        
        <p>The center is more than just a facility; it’s a critical step towards integrating immersive technologies into our educational and community initiatives, ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to engage with and benefit from these advanced tools.</p>
        
        <p>In addition to augmented and virtual reality, the Center offers access to games and gaming technologies, allowing faculty and students to experience off-the-shelf or custom made games to see what might be applicable to use in their classroom.</p>
        
        <p>Additionally, GRID will be hosting several events and regular meetings on related topics, such as Gamification, Generative AI, Game-based Learning, and more.</p>
        
        <p>We also experiment with new technologies as they become available. Below, see these images of the lab recreated as a 3D environment with just a few pictures.</p>
