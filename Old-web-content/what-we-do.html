<h2>Our Mission:</h2>

<p style="font-size:26px;">Building innovative games, immersive technologies, and engaging experiences to improve education.</p>

<p>Game Research and Immersive Design (GRID) works with faculty, staff, students, and others within the Rutgers community. We explore the use of emerging technologies and game design techniques to build games for change, empathy, instruction and research.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Founded by Rick Anderson in 2007, GRID started working with technologies such as SecondLife to bring immersive experiences to educational courses. The unit was Initially named Virtual Worlds, but was renamed Game Research and Immersive Design in 2015 when the unit became part of the Teaching and Learning with Technology department. This name change also represented the growing areas and services GRID supported.</p>
